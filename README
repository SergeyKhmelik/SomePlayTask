Final task by Serhii Khmelyk
=================================

Technical requirements:
1. Internet connection
2. Java 8
3. PostgreSQL DB


Installation:
1. Configure your DB connection in conf/application.conf file (username, password, url).
You should create "infostroy_play_db" database.
2. Go to the project root directory and type "activator run" in terminal.
3. In your browser head for localhost:9000 url.
4. Done! Now you can enjoy the application working.
You can log in as an administrator using "admin" username and "admin" password.

As plus:
1. QueryDSL is used.
2. Logging applied on each controller class.
3. CSRF protection applied.
3. Uploaded on Heroku cloud app service. You can access this application by url:
http://tranquil-beyond-90785.herokuapp.com/ It is ok if app will take some time on first load.

Small application guide about some tricky situations, that can occur (admin vs anonymous user collisions):
1. Anonymous user has access only to one page. Unauthorized user can answer the questioner.

2. If anonymous user loads questioner page and then admin adds new required field, user will receive a warning that his answer has outdated data and will be asked to refresh the page.

3. If anonymous user answers on a multichoicable field while admin deletes the chosen option - user will receive a Warning message that some options can be outdated and will be asked to refresh the page.

4. If anonymous user answers the questioner while admin deletes some field - users answer will be saved without deleted field_answer.

5. Admin can log in to system by entering his credentials into "Login" modal, that can be accessed from navbar. Default login and password are "admin", "admin".

6. Admin can create new fields, delete old fields, edit existing fields and overview users' results info.

7. Admin cannot create new field with already existing label. Admin also cannot create a new multioptional field with less then 2 unique not empty options. All option and label values are trimmed therefore whitespaces won't work.

8. Admin can edit the whole field properties if there is no answer on this field yet. Admin can edit only "required" and "active" field if the field has been already answered.

9. Admin can delete every field.

10. Each time admin deletes a field, application will search for user responses, that have no answers (all answers are shown as "N/A" in responses table) and remove them from DB.
